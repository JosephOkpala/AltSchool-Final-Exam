# AltSchool Africa Third Semester Exam

#### In this project I will be using the GitHub API to get my repositories and display it. I will also use nested routes to show more information on the repo clicked. I have also implemented a wildcard route, when an invalid route is entered it displays the error page. When the repositories have been fetched there is also a form of pagination that lets you see only a limited amount of repos on a page, by clicking on the Next and Prev button you can see other repos. You can also skip pages with the numbers displayed.
#### This project is built on Vue Js as the framework and CSS3 for styling.
